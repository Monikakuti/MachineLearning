🏠 House Price Predictor — Linear Regression Mini Project

📌 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning mini project to predict house prices using Linear Regression. It's part of my personal journey to learn ML from scratch.

I used a synthetic dataset generated with the help of ChatGPT that simulates realistic housing data — including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location score, and house age.

🎯 Objective
Train a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on key features and deploy it as an interactive web app using Streamlit.

📊 Features Used

Feature	         Description
SquareFeet	     Size of the house in sq. feet
Bedrooms	       Number of bedrooms
Bathrooms	       Number of bathrooms
LocationScore	   Rating of the locality (1–10)
Age	             Age of the house in years
Price	           Target variable (price in ₹)

🧪 Model Performance
✅ R² Score: 0.977
✅ Mean Absolute Error: ₹47,839
✅ Mean Squared Error: ₹34.1 Cr
(on a synthetic dataset of 1000+ records)

🚀 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Streamlit (web app interface)


✨ Learning Reflection
This project helped me:
Understand how linear regression works
Learn to evaluate models using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²
Practice visualizing data and model performance
Build and deploy a beginner-friendly ML web app

I'm just getting started — more projects coming soon!
