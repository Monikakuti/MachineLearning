# 🧠 Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning repository!  
This is where I document my learnings, mini projects, and practice code as I explore the world of ML.

## 📚 What's Inside
- 🔹 Core ML concepts with simple explanations  
- 🔹 Code examples using Python (with Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- 🔹 Mini projects and visualizations  
- 🔹 Practice notebooks

## 🚀 Goals
- Understand ML fundamentals clearly  
- Build hands-on mini projects  
- Prepare for real-world data science roles  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
