# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction - Logistic Regression (Mini Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a **loan application will be approved** or not based on applicant data like gender, income, and credit history.

> ✅ Output: `1 = Approved`, `0 = Not Approved`
