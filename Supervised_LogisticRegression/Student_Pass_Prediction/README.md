# 🎓 Student Pass/Fail Prediction - Logistic Regression (Mini Project)

This mini-project predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on the number of hours studied and sleep hours using **Logistic Regression** (a classification algorithm in machine learning).

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Hours_Studied` – Number of hours the student studied
- `Sleep_Hours` – Hours of sleep per day
- `Passed` – 1 if the student passed, 0 if failed

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 ML Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Model training with `LogisticRegression`
4. Prediction on test data
5. Accuracy evaluation
