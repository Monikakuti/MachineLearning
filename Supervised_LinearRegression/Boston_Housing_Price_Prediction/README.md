# 🏡 Boston Housing Price Prediction

This mini project uses the Boston Housing dataset to predict house prices using Linear Regression.

## 📊 Dataset
Boston Housing Dataset with features like:
- CRIM: Crime rate
- RM: Average rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Age of house
- LSTAT: % lower income people
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio
- MEDV: Median value of house (Target)

## 🎯 Goal
To predict the median value of homes (`MEDV`) based on various features using Linear Regression.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
  
## 🚀 Steps
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Selected features and target (`MEDV`).
3. Split into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model.
5. Evaluated the model using MSE and R² Score.
6. Visualized the relationship between RM and MEDV.

## ✅ Result
Model was able to predict house prices based on multiple features. Visualization shows a strong linear relationship between rooms and price.
