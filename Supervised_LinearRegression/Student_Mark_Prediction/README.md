# 🎓 Student Marks Prediction using Linear Regression

This mini project builds a simple linear regression model to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied.

## 📊 Dataset
Simulated dataset containing:
- Hours_Studied
- Marks

## 🎯 Goal
To predict a student’s mark based on their study hours using Linear Regression.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Steps
1. Created a simple dataset of study hours and marks.
2. Split into training and testing sets.
3. Trained a Linear Regression model.
4. Evaluated the model using R² Score and MSE.
5. Visualized the regression line.

## ✅ Result
Model successfully predicted marks based on study hours with a perfect fit on this small dataset.
